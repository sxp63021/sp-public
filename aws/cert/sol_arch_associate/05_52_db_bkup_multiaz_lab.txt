=========
There are two different types of Backups for RDS:
- Automated Backups
- Database Snapshots

ReadReplicas
- Can be Multi-AZ
- Used to increase performance
- Must have backups turned on
- Can be in different regions
- Can be MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, Aurora
- Can be promoted to master, this will break the Read Replica

MultiAZ
- Use for DR
- You can force a failover from one AZ to another by rebooting
  the RDS instance

Encryption at rest is supported for MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL,
MariaDB & Aurora. Encryption is done using the AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
service. Once your RDS instance is encrypted, the data stored at rest in the
underlying storage is encrypted, as are its automated backups, read replicas,
and snapshots.
