=========

What Have We Learnt So Far?

a. IAM is universal. It does not apply to regions at this time.
b. The "root account" is simply the account created when first setup
   your AWS account. It has complete Admin access.
c. New Users have NO permissions when first created
d. New Users are assigned Access Key ID and Secret Access Keys when
   first created
e. These are not the same as a password. You cannot use the Access
   key ID & Secret Access Key to Login into the console. You can use
   this to access AWS via the APIs and Command Line, however
f. You only get to view these once. If you loose them, you have to
   regenerate them. So, save them in a secure location.

What you have learnt so Far?

a. Always setup MFA on your root account
b. You can create and customise your own password rotation policies.
