TITLE: Network Access Control Lists (ACL) vs Security Groups

Exam Tips
=========

* Your VPC automatically comes with a default network ACL, and by default
  it allows all outbound and inbound traffic
* You can create customer network ACLs.By default, each custom network ACL
  defines all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules.
* Each subnetw in your VPC must be associated with a network ACL. If you don't
  explicitly associate a subnet with a network ACL, the subnet is automatically
  associated with the default network ACL

* You can assocaite a network ACL with multiple subnets, however, a subnet can
  only be associated with only one network ACL at a time. When you associate a
  network ACL with a subnet, the previous association is removed
* NEtwork ACLs contain a numbered list of rules that is evaluated in order,
  starting with the lowest numbered rules
* Network ACLs have seperate inbound and outbound rules, and each rules can 
  either allow or deny traffic
* Network ACLs are stateless, reponses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to
  the rules for outbound traffic (and vice versa)
