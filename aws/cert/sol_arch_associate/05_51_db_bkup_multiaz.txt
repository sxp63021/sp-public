TITLE: RDS - Back Ups, Multi-AZ & Read Replicas

=================================
Back Ups with RDS

There are two different types of Backups for RDS:

- Automated Backups
- Database Snapshots

=================================
Automated Backups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Automated Backups allow you to receover your database to any
point in time within a "retention period". The retention perion can be between
1 and 35 days. Automated Backups will take a full daily snapshot and will also
store transaction logs throughout the data. When you do a recovery, AWS will
first choose the most recent daily back up, and then apply transaction logs
relevant to that day. This allows you to do a point in time recovery down to
a second, within the retention period.

Automated Backups are enabled by default. The backup data is stored in S3 and
you get free storage space equal to the size of your database. So if you have
and RDS instance of 10Gb, you will get 10Gb worth of storage.

Backups are taken within a defined window. During the backup window, storage
I/O may be suspended while your data is being backed up and you may experience
elevated latency.

=================================
Database Snapshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DB Snapshots are done manually (i.e they are user initiated). They are stored 
even after you delete the original RDS instance, unlike automated backups.

=================================
Restoring Backups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever you restore either an Automatic Backup or a manual Snapshot, the
restored version of the database will be a new RDS instance with a new DNS
endpoint

=================================
Encryption At Rest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Encyption at rest is supported for MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, 
MariaDB & Autora. Encryption is done using the AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
service. Once your RDS instance is encrypted, the data stored at rest in the
underlying storage is encrypted, as are its automated backups, read replicas,
and snapshots.

=================================
What is Multi-AZ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Multi-AZ allows you to have an exact copy of your production db in another 
Availability Zone. AWS handles the replication for you, so when your production
db is writted to, this write will automatically be synchronized to the standby
db.

In the event of planned db maintenance, db instance failure, or an Availability
Zone failure, Amazon RDS will automatically failover to the standby so that
database operations can resume quickly without administrative intervention.

Multi-AZ is primarily of Disaster Recovery only. Not for performance improvement
For performance improvement you need Read Replicas

Multi-AZ support is availble for the following databases
- SQL Server
- Oracle
- MySQL Server
- PostgrSQL
- MariadDB

Aurora by the Architecture itself is completely fault tolerant

=================================
What is A ReadReplica
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Read replicas allow you to have a read-only copy of your production db.
This is achiteved by using Async replication from the primary RDS instance to
the read replica. You use read replicas primarily for very read-heavy database
workloads.

Back Ups With RDS
------------------
Read Replicas are available for the following databases
- MySQL Server
- PostgreSQL
- MariaDB
- Oracle
- Aurora

Things to know about Read Replicas;
- Used for scaling, not for DR! (Disaster Recovery)
- Must have automatic backups turned on in order to deploy a read replica
- You can have upto 5 read replica copies of any database
- You can have read replicas of read replicas (but watch out for latency)

- Each read replica will have its own DNS end point.
- You can have read replicas that have Multi-AZ
- You can create read replicas of Multi-AZ source databases
- Read replicas can be promoted to be their own databases. This breaks 
  the replication
- You can have a read replica in a second region
