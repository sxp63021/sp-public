TITLE:  LAB - CROSS REGION REPLICATION

=================================
For Replication to be enabled, Versioning has to be enabled first

When replicating a bucket
 - we need to have a new name to the s3 bucket
 - we can change the owner if needed
 - we can also change the storage type (S3-IA)

When doing cross region replication, it will not get the files
already in the existing s3 bucket, we need to go ahead and upload them

If you put a delete marker in one bucket in region1, it will not put
a delete marker in the other bucket in cross region replication.

Replicate does not help to delete versions of files.

Exam Tips

* Versioning must be enabled on both the source and destination buckets
* Files in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically
* All susequent updated files will be replicated automatically
* Delete markers are not replicated
* Deleting individual versions or delete markers will not be replicated
* Understand what Cross Region Replication is at a high level.
