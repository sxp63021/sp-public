Exam Tips
=========

1. All Inbound traffic is blocked by default
2. All Outbound traffic is allowed
3. Changes to Security Groups take effect immediately
4. You can have any number of EC2 instances within a security group
5. You can have multiple security groups attached to EC2 Instances

Security Groups are STATEFUL
  - inbound rule will impact the outbound rule on same port
    no need to add an explicit outbound rule
  - If you create an inbout rule allowing traffic in, that traffic is
    automatically allowed back out again
  - You cannot block specific IP addresses using Security Groups, instead
    use Network Access Control Lists

  - You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules (this has to be done 
    in VPC)
