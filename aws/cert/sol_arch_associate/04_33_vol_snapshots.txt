TITLE: EBS Volumes and Snapshots - Lab
=================================

When we delete a EC2 instance, the EBS volumes that were added
needed not be deleted if it is not clicked originally

We need to go into volumes and delete the volume afterwards

We can take a snapshot of the AMI once it is up and running
We can move this snapshot into another region where we want it to run

If there is a EBS volume, location of EBS volume will be in the same
location as the EC2 instance.

Exam Tips
=========

1. Volumes exist on EBS. Think of EBS as a virtual hard disk
2. Snapshots exist on S3. Think of snapshots as a photograph of the disk
3. Snapshots are point in time copies of Volumes
4. Snapshots are incremental - this means that only the blocks that have 
   changed since your last snapshot are moved to S3.
5. If it is the first snapshot, it will take sometime to create it

6. To create a snapshot for Amazon EBS volumes that serve as root devices, 
   you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot.
7. However you can take a snap while the instance is running
8. You can create AMI's from Snapshots
9. You can change EBS volume sizes on the fly, including changing the size and
   storage type.

10. To move an EC2 volume from one AZ to another, take a snapshot of it,
    create an AMI from the snapshot and then use the AMI to launch the EC2
    instance in a new AZ
