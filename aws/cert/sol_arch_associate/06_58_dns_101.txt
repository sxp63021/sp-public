=================================
Route 53? Why is it named "Route 53".

First interstate was "Route 66" - from one side of country to another

Port 53 is used for DNS in the Operating system.

Mixing both these, it is called "Route 53".

Top Level domains

.com
.edu
.gov
.co.uk
.com.au

Popular Domain registrars include
Amazon, GoDaddy.com, 123-reg.co.uk, etc

=================================
NS stands for Name Server Records

	They are used by Top Level domain Servers to direct traffic to the Content
	DNS server which contains the authoritative DNS records

What's an A record?
An "A" record is the fundamental type of DNS record. the "A" in A record stands 
for "Address". the A record is used by a computer to translate the name of the
domain to an IP address.

What is TTL?
The length that a DNS record is cached on either the Resolving Server or the
users own local PC is equal to Time to Live (TTL) in seconds. Lower TTL, faster
change to DNS records take to propogate throughout the internet

What is CName?
A Canonical Name(CName) can be used to resolve one domain name to another. For
example, you may have a mobile website with the domain name http://m.acloudguru.com
that is used for people browing the site from mobile.
You also want the name http://mobile.acloudguru.com to resolve to this same
address


What is Alias REcords
Alias records are used to map resource record sets in your hosted zone to
Elastic Load Balancers, CloudFront distributions, or S3 buckets that are
configured as websites.

Alias records work like a CNAME record in that you can mape one DNS name
(www.example.com) to another 'target' DNS name (elb1234.elb.amazonaws.com)

Key diff between "Alias Records" and CNAME.
CNAMe cannot be used for naked domain names.
You can't havbe a CNAME for http://acloud.guru, it must be either
an A record or an Alias.
