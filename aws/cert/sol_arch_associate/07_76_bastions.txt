TITLE: Bastions or Jump Servers
=================================
What is a Bastion (Jumpserver) host?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A bastion host is a special purpose computer on a network specifically
designed and configured to withstand attacks. The computer generally
host a single application, for example a proxy server, and all other
services are remove or limited to reduce the thread to the computer.

It is hardened in this manner primarily due to its location and purpose,
which is either on the outside of a firewall or in a DMZ (Demiliarized zone)
and usually involves access from untrusted networks or computers.
