TITLE: ENI vs ENA vs EFA

=================================
ENI = Elastic Network Interface - esentially a virtual network card
	  Low Budget, High Availability solution

EN - Enhanced Networking. Uses single root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)
     to provide high-performance networking capabilities on supported
	 instance types
	 - Provides higher bandwidth, higher packets per second (PPS_
	 - lower inter-instance latencies
	 - Use here you want good network performance
	 - ENA can give upto 100 Gbps
	 - EN VF (Virtual Function) can give upto 10 Gbps

EFA - Elastic Fiber Adapter
	  A network device that you can attach to your amazon EC2
	  to accelerate High Performance Computing (HPC) and ML apps
	  - EFA provides lower and most consistent latency, higher throughput
	  - EFA can use OS-bypass. OS-bypass -bypass o/s kernel and communicate
	    directly with EFA device. Lower latency.
	    Currently supported on Linux only.

Exam Tips
=========

ENI
	For all basic networking. Might need a separate management ntk to your
	production ntf or separate logging ntk and you need to do this at low cost
	Multiple ENIs for each network
EN
	For speeds from 10Gbps and 100 Gbps. Need reliable high throughput

EFA
	You need HPC and ML applications. Need OS-bypass, use this approach
