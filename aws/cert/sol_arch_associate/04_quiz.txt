Spread Placement Groups can be deployed across multiple Availability Zones
You have developed a new web application in the US-West-2 Region that requires six Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances to be running at all times. US-West-2 comprises three Availability Zones (us-west-2a, us-west-2b, and us-west-2c). You need 100 percent fault tolerance: should any single Availability Zone in us-west-2 become unavailable, the application must continue to run. How would you make sure 6 servers are ALWAYS available? NOTE: each answer has 2 possible deployment configurations. Select the answer that gives TWO satisfactory solutions to this scenario.

To retrieve instance metadata or user data you will need to use the following IP Address:
Will an Amazon EBS root volume persist independently from the life of the terminated EC2 instance to which it was previously attached? In other words, if I terminated an EC2 instance, would that EBS root volume persist?
