TITLE: NAT Instances and NAT Gateways - LAB

NAT = Network Address Translation
=================================

NAT Instance - individual EC2 instances that just help to do the NATting

NAT Gateway is a highly available instance, that allow private instance
to communicate with the public network out there.

Exam Tips
=========
* When creating NAT instance, Disable Source/Destination Check on the Instance
* NAT instances must be in a public subnet
* There must be a route out of the private subnet to the NAT instance, in order
  for this to work.
* The amount of traffic that NAT instances can support depends on the instance
  size. If you are bottlenecking, increase the instance size.
* You can create high availability using Autoscaling Groups, multiple subnets
  in different AZs, and a script to automate failover.
* Behind a Security Group

* Redundant inside the Availability Zone
* Preferred by the enterprise
* Starts at 5Gbps and scaled currently to 45 Gbps
* No need to patch
* Not associated with security groups
* Automatically assigned a public ip address
* Remember to update your route tables
* No need to disable Source/Destination Checks
