TITLE:  AMI Types (EBS vs Instance Store)

=================================
AMI's

You can select your AMI based on:
	- Region (see Regions and Availability Zones)
	- Operating system
	- Architecture (32-bit or 64-bit)
	- Launch Permissions
	- Storage for the Root Device (Root Device Vol Instance Store()
		Ephemeral Storage), EBS Backed Volumes


=================================
EBS vs Instance Store Volumes

All AMIs are categorized as either backed by Amazon EBS or backed by
instance store

For EBS Volumes: The root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an
				Amazon EBS volume created from an Amazon EBS snapshot

For Instance Store Volumes: The root device for an instance launched from the
				 AMI is an instance store volume created from a template stored
				 in Amazon S3.
	
=================================

If the EC2 instance is created from the AMI store avialble on Amazon, then we will
not see any volumes in the Elastic Block Store -> Volumes section

Also for this EC2 instance, we cannot start or stop. We can only Terminate the 
instance
=================================

Exam Tips
=========

1. Instance Store Volumes are sometimes called Ephemeral Storage
2. Instance Store volumes cannot bes topped. If the underlying host fails, you will
   loose your data.
3. EBS backed instances can be stopped. You will not loose the data on this instance
   if it is stopped.
4. You can reboot both, you will not loose your data
5. By default, both ROOT volumes will be deleted on termination. However, with EBS
   volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume.
