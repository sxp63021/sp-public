TITLE:  What is EFS?

=================================
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) is a file storage service for Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances.

Amazon EFS is easy to use and provides a simple interface that allows you to
create and configure file systems quickly and easily. With Amazon EFS, storage
capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove
files, so your applications have the storage they need, when they need it.
