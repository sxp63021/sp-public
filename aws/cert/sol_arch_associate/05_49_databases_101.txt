TITLE: Databases 101

=================================
Relational databases on AWS;

1. SQL Server (microsoft)
2. Oracle
3. MySQL Server
4. PostgreSQL
5. Aurora (amazon db sol)
6. MariaDB (used in financial industry)

=================================
Multi-AZ vs ReadReplicas

RDS has two key features:
	- Multi-AZ - For Disaster Recovery
		- set your db in replicated fashion
		- if one machine goes down, AWS will use the dns name to divert
		  requests to another machine
	- Read Replicas - For Performance
		- if one machine goes down, user will need to change dns name to
		  point to the other DB
		- in one setup, if DB is mainly for reading, each EC2 can point to diff
		  DB so improve performance

=================================
Non Relational Databases

* Collection 		= Table (Relational DB)
* Document   		= Row (Relational DB)
* Key Value Pair 	= Fields (Relational DB)

=================================
What is Data Warehousing?

Used for business intelligence. Tools like Cognos, Jaspersoft, SQL Server
Reporting Services, Oracle Hyperion, SAP NetWeaver.

Used to pull in very large and complex data sets. Usually used by management
to do queries on data (such as current performance Vs. targets etc)

=================================
OLTP Vs OLAP

Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) differs from Online Analytics Processing
(OLAP) in terms of the types of querues you will run.

OLTP Example:
Order # - 2120121
Pulls up a row of adata such as Name, Date, Address to Deliver to, Delivery Status, etc

=================================
OLTP Vs OLAP (Contd..)

OLAP Transaction Example:
Net Profit for EMEA and Pacific for the Digital Radio PRoduct.
Pulls in large number of records

- Sum of Radios Sold in EMEA
- Sum of Radios Sold in Pacific
- Unit Cost of Radio in each Region
- Sales price of each radio
Sales price - unit cost

Data Warehousing databases use different type of architecture both from a database
perspective and infrastructure layer.

Amazon's Datawarehouse solution is Called Redshift

=================================
What is ElastiCache?

ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and savel and
in-memory cache in the cloud. The service improves the performance of the web
applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed,
in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases

ElastiCache supports two open-source in-memory caching engines:
- Memchached
- Redis

One example, 
 
If a lot of customers are always asking for the top 10 sold items,
this can be cached, so we can return these values quickly rather
than recompute every time.

Second example:
Web page like finance.yahoo always displays the top sold stock by volume
Something like this can be in cache, so need not recompute everytime.

Exam Tips
=========

Relational databases (RDS) avbl on AWS:

1. SQL Server (microsoft)
2. Oracle
3. MySQL Server
4. PostgreSQL
5. Aurora (amazon db sol)
6. MariaDB (used in financial industry)

DynamcoDB (NoSQL)
Red Shift OLAP (Business Intelligence or Data Warehouse)

ElastiCache helps to speed up performance of existing databases (frequent
identical queries).
