TITLE: Amazon EFx for Windows and Lusture

=================================
Amazon FSx for Windows File Server provides fully managed native Microsoft
Windows file system so you can easily move your Windows-based applications
that require file storage to AWS. Amazon FSx is built on Windows Server

=================================

Example of Applications that needs Windows File Server
- IIS
- Sharepoint
- Active Directory
- SQL Server
=================================
How is Windows FSx different to EFS?

- A managed Windows Server that runs Windows Server Message Block (SMB)
  based file services
- Designed for Windows and Windows applications
- Supports AD users, access control lists, groups and security policies,
  along with Distributed File System (DFS) namespaces and replication

EFS
- A managed NAS filer for EC2 instances based on NFS v4
- One of the first network file sharing protocols native to Unix and Linux

=================================
Amazon FSx for Lusture is a fully managed file system that is optimized for
compute-intensive workloads, such as high-performance computing, ML, media
data processing workflows, and electronic design automation (EDA).

With Amazon FSX, you can launch and run a Lustre file system that can process
massive data sets at upto hundreds of gigabytes per second of throughput,
millions of IOPS, and sub millisecond latencies
=================================
Lustre FSx Vs EFS

Lustre FSx
~~~~~~~~~~
- Designed specifically for fast processing of workloads such as ML, HPC, video
  processing, financial modeling and electronic design automation (EDA)
- Lets you launch and run a file system that provides sub-millisecond access to
  your data and allows you to read and write data at speeds of upto hunderds of
  gigabytes per second of throughput and millions of IOPS

EFS
~~~~
- A managed NAS filer for EC2 instances based on NFS v4
- One of the first network file sharing protocols native to Unix and Linux

Exam Tips
=========
In the exam you'll be given different scenarios and asked to choose whether you
should use an EFS, FSx for Windows or FSx for Lustre.

EFS
~~~
- When you need distributed, highly resilient storage for Linux instances and
  Linux-based applications

Amazon FSx for Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- When you need centralized storage for Windows-based appl such as Sharepoint,
  Microsoft SQL Server, Workspaces, IIS Web Server or any other native MS Appl

Amazon FSx for Lustre
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- When you need high-speed, high capacity distributed storage. This will be for
  applications that do High Performance Computer (HPC), financial modelling etc.
  Remember that FSx for Lustre can store data directly on S3
