TITLE:  AWS WAF

=================================
At its most basic level, AWS WAF allows 3 different behaviours:

1. Allow all requests except the ones you specify
2. Block all requests except the ones you specify
3. Count the requests that match the properties you specify

=================================
WAF Protection

Extra protection against web attacks using conditions you specify.
You can define conditions by using characteristics of web request such as:

* IP addresses that requests originate from
* Country that requests originate from
* Values in request headers
* Strings that appear in requests, either specific strings or string that match
  regular expression (regex) patterns.
* Length of requests
* Presence of SQL code that is likely to be malicious (known as SQL injection)
* Presence of a script that is likely to be malicious (known as cross-site scripting)
