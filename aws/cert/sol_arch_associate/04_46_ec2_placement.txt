TITLE: EC2 Placement Groups

=================================
Three Types of Placement Groups
- Clustered Placement Group
- Spread Placement Group
- Partitioned

=================================
Clustered Placement Group

A cluster placement group is a grouping of instances within a single Availability
Zone. Placement groups are recommended for applications that need low network
latency, high network throughput, or both.

Only certain isntances can be launched into a Clustered Placement Group.
=================================
Spread Placement Group

a spread placement group is a group of instances that are each placed on distinct
underlying hardware.

Spread placement groups are recommended for applications that have a small number
of critical instances that should be kept separate from each others.

THINK INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES
=================================
Partitioned Placement Group

When using partition placement groups, Amazon EC2 divides each group into logical
segments called partitions. Amazon EC2 ensures that each partition within a 
placement group has its own set of racks. Each rack has its own network and
power source. No two paritions within a placement group share the same racks,
allowing you to isolate the impact of hardware failure withing your application.

THINK MULTIPLE INSTANCES

3 Types of Placement Groups

- Clustered Placement Group
	- Low Network Latency/High Network Throughput

- Spread Placement Group
	- Individual Critical EC2 instances

- Partitioned
	- Multiple EC2 instances HDFS, HBase and Cassandra


* A clustered placement group can't span multiple Availability Zones
* A spread placement and paritioned group can
* The name your specify for a placement group must be unique withing your
  AWS account
* Only certain types of instances can be launched in a placement group (Compute
  Optimized, GPU, Memory Optimized, Storage Optimized)
* AWS recommended homogenous instances within clustered placement groups
* You can't merge placement groups
* You can move an existing instance into a placement group. Before you move the
  instance, the instance must be in the stopped state. You can move or remove
  an instance using the AWS CLI or AWS SDK, you can't do it via the console yet
