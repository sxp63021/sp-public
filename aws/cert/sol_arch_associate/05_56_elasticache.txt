TITLE: Elasticache

=================================
What is ElastiCache?

ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale
an in-memory cache in the cloud. 

The service improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to
retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory caches, instead of relying
entirely on slower disk-based databases.

ElastiCache supports two open-source in-memory caching engines:
a. Memcached
b. redis
