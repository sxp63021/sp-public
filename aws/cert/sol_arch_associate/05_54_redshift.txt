TITLE: Redshift

=================================
What is Redshift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Amazon Redshift is a fast and powerful, fully managed, petabyte scale data
warehouse service in the cloud. Customers can start small for just $0.25 per
hour with no commitments or upfront costs and scale to a petabyte per year,
less than a tenth of most other data warehousing solutuons.

=================================
OLTP Vs OLAP

OLAP transaction Example:
Net Profit for EMEA and Pacific for the Digital Radio Product.
Pulls in large numbers of records

Sum of Radios Sold in EMEA
Sum of Radios Sold in Pacific
Unit Cost of Radio in each region
Sales price of each radio
Sales price - unit cost

Data Warehousing database use different type of architecture both from a db
perspective and infrastructure layer.

=================================
Redshift Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Redshift can be configured as follows
- Single Node (160Gb)
- Multi Node
	- Leader Node (manages client connections and receives queries)
	- Compute Node (store data and perform queries and computations). 
	  Upto 128 Compute Nodes

=================================
Advanced Compression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Columnar data stores can be compressed much more than row-based data stores
because similar data is stored sequentially on disk. Amazon Redshift employs
multiple compression techniques and can oftern achieve significant compression
relative to traditional relational data stores. In addition, Amazon Redshift
doesn't require indexes or materialized views, and so uses less space than 
traditional relational database systems. When loading data into an empty table,
Amazon Redshift automatically samples your data and selects the most appropriate
compression scheme.

=================================
Massively Parallel Processing (MPP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Amazon Redshift automatically distributes data and query load across all nodes.
Amazon Redshift makes it easy to add nodes to your data warehouse and enables
you to maintain fast query performance as your data warehouse grows.

=================================
Backups
~~~~~~~~~

- Enabled by default with a 1 day retention period
- Max retention period is 35 days
- Redshift always attempts to maintain at least three copies of your data
  (the original and replica on the compute nodes and a backup in Amazon S3)
- Redshift can also async replicate your snapshots to S3 in another region
  for disaster recovery.
