1. While doing the AWS course, i was trying to see if we can do C++
   programs run in AWS? How to do that? What can i do?

A. There is a C++ SDK released by AWS
   Date of Release: 2015
   Link of Website: https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp/
   Chk out on web : - Getting Started
					- Developer Blog
					- Developer Guide
					- API Reference
   Some of the Sample Stuff we can do from C++ using AWS SDK (samples from Blog)
   - Developer Experience of the AWS SDK for C++ Now Simplified by CMake
   - Cross-Platform Text-to-Speech for C++ with Amazon Polly
   - Amazon S3 Encryption Client Now Available for C++ Developers
   - Symmetric Encryption/Decryption in the AWS SDK for C++ with std::iostream
   - AWS SDK for C++: Simplified Configuration and Initialization
   - Using a Thread Pool with the AWS SDK for C++


Q. any blogs on the internet experimenting on this front?
A. I saw a post by Bartek from Poland
   Link: https://www.bfilipek.com/2020/01/amazon-aws-cpp.html

   Bartek's Blog in general talks about C++ 17, 20 features - checkit out

Q. What did you understand from above info?
A. What i understood from above info was, we can use C++ to programatically
   use AWS API or AWS Services
   This is made possible using AWS SDK for C++

   I keep seeing some requiremens that we need to encrypt logs before putting them
   in AWS S3. So the SDK helps to encrypt/decrypt logs and put them in S3.

Q. Do you see any videos in youtube?
A. Yes, i saw some videos in youtube
   Example1:

    This is #68 in my series of live (Twitch) coding streams, working on various 
    projects in C++.
  
    This stream I started work on a library for interfacing with Amazon Web 
    Services (AWS), beginning with the proper signing of AWS API calls.

   Example2:
   User: CloudBedrock
   Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaWLaOfqoy8

   This is a simple walk through of using the new AWS Lambda Runtime API with 
   C++ which allows you to use the C++ programming language with Amazon AWS 
   Lambda.

   This walk through follows the AWS Blog Article available here: 
   https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-the-c-lambda-runtime/

   This user was using Amazon Cloud9 IDE
   https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/

   I did not see any other videos other than just this one in his channel

Q. Some on quora was asking how C++ will help for a job in AWS?

Q. Any reviews about amazon IDE Cloud9 cloud 9
