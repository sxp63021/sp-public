TITLE:  S3 Transfer Acceleration

=================================
S3 Transfer Acceleration utilises the CloudFront Edge Network to accelerate
your uploads to S3.

Instead of uploading directly to your S3 bucket, you can use a distinct URL to
upload directly to an edge location which will then transfer that files to S3.

You will get a distinct URL to upload to:
Example: acloudguru.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com
