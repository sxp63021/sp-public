=========

Remember the following:
* When you create a VPC a default Route Rable, Network Access Control
  List (NACL) and a default Security Group

* It won't create any subnetws, nor will it create a default internet gateway

* US-East-1A in your AWS account can be a completely different availability
  zone to US-East-1A in another AWS account. the AZs are randomized

* Amazon always reserves 5 IP addresses within your subnets

* You can only have 1 Internet Gateway per VPC

* Security Groups can't span VPCs
