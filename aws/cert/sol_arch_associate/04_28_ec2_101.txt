TITLE:  EC2 101

=================================
What is EC2?

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides
resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required
to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly
scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.

=================================
EC2 Pricing Models

a. On Demand 	b. Reserved 	c. Spot 	d. Dedicated Hosts

1. On Demand
   Useful for users that want the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2
   without any up-front payment or long-term commitment

   Applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that
   cannot be interrupted

   applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time

2. Reserved
   Reserved pricing is useful for Applications with steady state or predictable
   usage

   Applications that require reserved capacity

   Users able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs
   even further

3. Spot
   Applications that have flexible start and end times
   Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices
   Users with urgent computing needs for large amts of additional capacity

4. Dedicated Hosts
   Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant
   virtualization
   Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments
   Can be purchased On-Demand(hourly)
   Can be purchased as a Reservation for upto 70% off the On-Demand price

Exam Tips
=========

* If the Spot instance is terminated by Amazon EC2, you will not be charged for
  that particular hour. If you terminate it by yourself, you will be charged for
  the full hour
