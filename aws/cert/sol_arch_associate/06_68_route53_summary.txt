- You can buy domain names directly with AWS
- It can take upto 3 days to register depending on the circumstances

Simple Routing Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you choose the simple routing policy you can only have one record with 
multiple IP addresses. If you specify multiple values in a record, Route 53
returns all values to the user in a random order.

Health Check cannot be enabled on this Policy

Weighted Routing Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Allows you to split the traffic based on diff weights assigned

- You can set health checks on individual record sets
- If a record set fails a health check, it will be removed from Route53
  until it passes the health check
- You can set SNS notifications to alert you if a health check is failed

Latency Routing Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Allows you to route your traffic based on the lowest network latency for
your end user (i.e which region will give them the fastest response time).

To use latency-based routing, you create a latency resource record set for the
Amazon EC2 (or ELB) resource in each region that hosts your website.
When Amazon Route 53 receives a query for your site, it selects the latency
resource record set for the region that gives the user the lowest latency.
Route 53 then responds with the value associated with that resource record set

Failover Routing Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Active Passive Sites.
If an Active Site is not reachable, Passive side will be promoted to Active state

Primary and Secondary are other words to refer to this Policy

Geolocation Routing Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Geolocation routing lets you choose where your traffic will be sent based on
the geographic location of your users (i.e the location from which DNS queries
originate). 

For example, you might want all queries from Europe to be routed
to a fleet of EC2 instances that are specifically configured for your European
customers. 

These servers may have the local language of your European customers
and all prices are displayed in Euros

Geoproximity Routing Policy (Traffic Flow Only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Geoproximity routing lets Amazon Route 53 route traffic to your resources based
on the geographic location of your users and your resources.

You can also optionally choose to route more traffic or less to a given resource
by specifying a value, known as a bias. A bias exmpands or shrinks the size of
the geographic region from which traffic is routed to a resource.

To use geoproximity routing, you must use Route53 traffic flow.

Multivalue Answer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In Simple Routing, we see that "health check" cannot be enabled.
Mutlivalue Answer helps in this contexted, each entry must be added seperately

Multivalue answer routing lets you configure Amazon Route 53 to return multiple
values, such as IP addresses for your web servers, in response to DNS queries.

You can specify multiple values for almost any record, but multivalue answer
routing also lets you check the health of each resource, so Route53 returns
only values for healthy resources.

This is similar to simple routing, however it allows you to put health
checks on each record set.


Exam Tips
~~~~~~~~~
- ELBs do not have pre-defined IPv4 addresses, you resolve to them using a
  DNS name.
- Understand the difference between an Alias Record and a CNAME
- Given the choice, always choose an Alias Record over a CNAME

Common DNS Types
- SOA Records
- NS Records
- A Records
- CNAMES
- MX Records

Routing Policies
- Simple Routing
- Weighted Routing
- Latency-based Routing
- Failover Routing
- Geolocation Routing
- Geoproximity Routing (Traffic Flow Only)
- Multivalue Answer Routing

Health Checks
- You can set health checks on individual record sets
- If a record set fails a health check it will be removed from Route53
  until it passess the health check
- You can set SNS notification to alert you if a health check is failed
