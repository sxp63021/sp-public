Inno setup stable build can be found at https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php#stable

Inno setup helps to package files into an installation file
- this helps to install files
- this also helps in uninstall

While using this application to create a sample binary
- MyAppName, this needs to be the folder where the binaries are placed
  this somehow gets into the variable {app} that is used in the script
- if you want to put any files in C:\ProgramData, use {commonappdata}
- if you want to just create a directory, we can use the [Dirs] section
