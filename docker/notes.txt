Docker Install commands
========================
1. sudo apt install docker
   might have to add the repo first
   sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable"
   apt-cache policy docker-ce
2. sudo apt install docker-ce
3. sudo systemctl status docker -> check if docker is running as a service
   sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER} -> do this so the user can run docker without using sudo
   -OR- sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)
   Caution: One needs to logout and login to see if docker is working without sudo
4. sudo docker run hello-world -> first application to check if docker is running

5.  docker run hello-world
6. docker search debian | grep ubuntu
7. docker images -> to see what images are available on your own system
8. sudo apt install docker-compose
