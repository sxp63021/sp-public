Docker Install commands
========================
1. sudo apt install docker
   might have to add the repo first
   sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable"
   apt-cache policy docker-ce
2. sudo apt install docker-ce
3. sudo systemctl status docker -> check if docker is running as a service
   sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER} -> do this so the user can run docker without using sudo
   -OR- sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)
   Caution: One needs to logout and login to see if docker is working without sudo
4. sudo docker run hello-world -> first application to check if docker is running

5.  docker run hello-world
6. docker search debian | grep ubuntu
7. docker images -> to see what images are available on your own system
8. sudo apt install docker-compose

----------
Docker was started with Linux in mind
To support Docker on Windows, Virtualization must be supported
docker creates a VM on Hyper-V 
hypervisors require hardware virtualization to be enabled
1. Some PCs have Hyper-V in bios that can be enabled
2. If PC does not have support for hardware virtualization, one needs to install Docker Toolbox(https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases) which uses "Oracle Virtual Box" to spin up VMs that will host docker containers instead of Hyper-V

    Looking for novice things to do on docker

9. docker pull busybox
10. docker run busybox
11. docker run busybox echo "Hello World from busybox"
12. docker run ps
13. docker run ps -a
14. docker run -it busybox sh -> to keep running a shell in the busy box, so one can see everything
	a. #uptime
	b. #...
15. docker rm $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited) -> delete docker stuff not running
16. docker container prune
     -OR-
    docker rmi -> delete images you no longer need

17. to stop a docker container
    docker stop <container_name_or_id>

docker image ls is giving error "Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.40/containers/json: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied"
$sudo groupadd docker
$ sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
logout and log back in
$docker run hello-world
