was trying a mysql jdbc connection to springboot application
missing dependency in pom.xml to mysql-connector-j
had to add, got error "dependency version is missing"
actual fix is to add version, so we know which version we need to use
only from Spring 3, not in Spring 2
~~~~
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-j</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
