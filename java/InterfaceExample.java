/*
Java 9 onward, you are allowed to include private methods in interfaces. Using private methods, now encapsulation is possible in interfaces as well.
...
Summary.
Method Type		Since When
public abstract	Java 7
public default	Java 8
public static	Java 8
private			Java 9
private static  Java 9

Fact: Prior to JDK 8, interface could not define implementation. We 
      can now add default implementation for interface methods.

Fact: Another feature that was added in JDK 8 is that we can now define 
      static methods in interfaces which can be called independently 
	  without an object. Note: these methods are not inherited.

Fact: Interfaces in Java help to achieve multiple inheritence and loose coupling

Fact: C++ equivalent of an interface is a class with pure virual methods
